Hi!
Last weekend I've been in my village, La pobleta, located on the interior of Valencia. The bonfires of San Blas were celebrated and all the road were full of them. My father and me were with a couple of friends and we had dinner all together.

We started with some appetizer: cheese, cold cuts and, of course, good wine. Next we put sausages, steaks... on the ember, delicious :P. And we finished with some handmade cakes.

It was a good weekend in my village.
