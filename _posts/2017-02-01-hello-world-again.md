Hi every one and welcome back to my blog. I know I'm writing in english but my teacher told me that, so here I am. Probably I have some mistakes so please don't tell her ;).

It's been a long time since last time I wrote a post but I'm very lazy, sorry for that. 2 years ago I was studying architecture degree in the UPV, but now I'm on associate degree of web development on IES Conselleria. I'm on the first year and I'm very bored... I've been programming for many years and I feel I'm loosing my time but I need a certificate because _Spain is different_ and companies won't hire me if I don't have the damn paper. For fuck's sake, see my Curriculum...

Well, after that, I promise I'll try to publish posts.

See you soon!
